abstract = {One of the central problems in wireless video transmission is the choice of source and channel coding rates to allocate the available transmission rate optimally. In this paper, we present a structural distortion model for video streaming over time-varying fading channels. Based on the model, we study the end-to-end distortion for various bit-rate allocation strategies and channel conditions. We show that the robustness to channel variations is crucial for the streaming performance when frequent bit-rate adaptations are not feasible. It is achieved at the expense of higher source distortion in the encoder. Our findings are illustrated on a practical problem of distortion-optimal selection of transport formats in an adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) scheme used in HSDPA.},

abstract = {Natural images have a characteristic spatial structure, with amplitude spectra that decrease with frequency roughly as 1/f. We have examined how contrast (pattern-selective) adaptation to this structure influences the spatial sensitivity of the visual system. Contrast thresholds and suprathreshold contrast and frequency matches were measured after adaptation to random samples from an ensemble of images of outdoor scenes or of synthetic images formed by filtering the amplitude spectra of noise over a range of spectral slopes. Adaptation selectively reduced sensitivity at low-to-medium frequencies, biasing contrast sensitivity toward higher frequencies. The pattern of aftereffects was similar for different natural image ensembles but varied with large changes in the slope of the noise spectra. Our results suggest that adaptation to the spatial structure in natural scenes may exert strong and selective influences on perception that are important in characterizing the normal operating states of the visual system.},

abstract = {Recently, broadcasted 3D video content has reached households with the first generation of 3DTV. However, few studies have been done to analyze the Quality of Experience (QoE) perceived by the end-users in this scenario. This paper studies the impact of trans- mission errors in 3DTV, considering that the video is delivered in side-by-side format over a conventional packet-based network. For this purpose, a novel evaluation methodology based on standard sin- gle stimulus methods and with the aim of keeping as close as pos- sible the home environment viewing conditions has been proposed. The effects of packet losses in monoscopic and stereoscopic videos are compared from the results of subjective assessment tests. Other aspects were also measured concerning 3D content as naturalness, sense of presence and visual fatigue. The results show that although the final perceived QoE is acceptable, some errors cause important binocular rivalry, and therefore, substantial visual discomfort.},

abstract = {The performance of 3D video transmission over error-prone channels is limited by the channel noise. Error concealment is an effective method to combat these channel errors. In H.264 video coding, motion vectors (MVs) are highly significant for the matching of the missing video block. Thus how to recover the lost MV is an important issue for error concealment in 3D video communications. In this paper, we propose a new method to recover the corrupted MVs for 3D video transmission, which is based on the traditional boundary matching algorithm (BMA) for the 2D video. Our proposed depth based BMA (DBMA) method will make full use of the relationships between the 2D video and depth map to recover the lost MV based on BMA. Experimental results show that it is highly effective and significantly outperforms other existing MV recovery methods for 3D video error concealment at different block loss ratios (BLRs)1.},

abstract = {In this paper, a new solution is introduced for the efficient compression of 3D video based on color and depth maps. While standard video codecs are designed for coding monoscopic videos, their application to depth maps is found to be suboptimal. With regard to the special properties of the depth maps, we propose an extension to conventional video coding in order to take advantage of object motion in the depth direction. Instead of performing a 2D motion search, as is common in conventional video codecs, we propose the use of a 3D motion search that is able to better exploit the temporal correlations of 3D content. In this new framework, the motion of blocks in depth maps are described using 3D motion vectors (x, y, z), representing the horizontal, vertical, and depth directions respectively. This leads to more accurate motion prediction and a smaller residual. The experimental results show that the proposed technique delivers an improvement in motion compensation, which leads to gains in compression efficiency.},

annote = {	Estimation of the quality is the key factor for design and optimization of any visual content. All quality metrics aim at close assessment of the quality as perceived by the user. The first step towards objective quality estimation metric is to identify the artifacts, which could arise in various usage scenarios involving stereoscopic content. 
	This papers proposes a classification of stereoscopic artifacts for portable devices, which list potential source of artifacts, and contemplates how they affect differents layers on human 3D vision.
	Not all the stereoscopic artifacts are like\c{c}y to affect mobile 3DTV systems.  

        
- Channel-related artifacts
	The most common and annoying artifact introducing in the process of capturing a stereoscopic image is unnatural disparity. Artifacts due to transmission errors are sparse, highly variants in termos of occurence, durantion and intensity, and at very low bit rates may be masked by compression impairments. The presence of artifacts depends very much on the coding algorithms used and how the decode copes with the channel errors.
	In multiview video encoding, where one channel is predicted from the other, usually error burst is long enough to affect both channels.
	One common artifact introduced during receiving and decoding of 3D video is temporal mismatch, where one channles gets delayed in respect to the other.
- Display-related artifacts
	The most pronounced artifact in autoestereoscopy display is cross-talk, caused by imperfect separation of the "left" and "right" image is preceived as ghosting artifacts.

Due to processing and distortions in transmission, the final display of visual data may contain artefacts. These can be classified into four types based on their origin: capture, processing (coding and decoding), delivery and display. The most significant cause of artefacts is the limited availability of bandwidth, and the tradeoffs associated with using this optimally. Often objective measures of image quality are poorly correlated with perceived image quality. This makes the effectiveness of various mitigation techniques harder to quantify.},

@article{Erturk2007,
abstract = {This letter presents a new perspective to block motion estimation for video compression referred to as high-frequency component matching. Taking into consideration the features of the transform encoder used to encode the prediction error in the motion-compensated predictive coding system, motion estimation is carried out such as to compensate for high-frequency components, leaving the compensation task of low-frequency components to the transform encoder. It is shown that this approach can outperform standard motion estimation that does not take transform encoder features into account and has the potential of changing the way motion estimation is being performed in video compression standards.},

@article{Fehn2004,
abstract = {This paper presents details of a system that allows for an evolutionary introduction of depth perception into the existing 2D digital TV framework. The work is part of the European Information Society Technologies (IST) project Advanced Three-Dimensional Television System Technologies (ATTEST), an activity, where industries, research centers and universities have joined forces to design a backwards-compatible, flexible and modular broadcast 3D-TV system. At the very heart of the described new concept is the generation and distribution of a novel data representation format, which consists of monoscopic color video and associated per- pixel depth information. From these data, one or more virtual views of a real-world scene can be synthesized in real-time at the receiver side (i. e. a 3D-TV set-top box) by means of so-called depth-image-based rendering (DIBR) techniques. This publication will provide: (1) a detailed description of the fundamentals of this new approach on 3D-TV; (2) a comparison with the classical approach of stereoscopic video; (3) a short introduction to DIBR techniques in general; (4) the development of a specific DIBR algorithm that can be used for the efficient generation of high-quality virtual stereoscopic views; (5) a number of implementation details that are specific to the current state of the development; (6) research on the backwards-compatible compression and transmission of 3D imagery using state-of-the-art MPEG (Moving Pictures Expert Group) tools.},

abstract = {Motion estimation demands intense computations. To overcome this obstacle, different techniques have been devised. In this paper an efficient spatio-temporal fuzzy search algorithm is proposed to shorten the search time without the loss of accuracy. To reduce the complexity of the algorithm a look-up table structure (LUT) is employed. Also the stationary blocks are treated separately for further reduction of the complexity. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs better than many of the fast block matching algorithms in terms of picture quality and computational complexity.},
